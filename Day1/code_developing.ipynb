    " * Finish the following free fall gravity simulator. Use your simulation to determine how long it takes for a particle to fall to the ground from a height of 10 meters. We will poll everyone on what result they get.\n",
    " * Bonus activity: In the future, we want particles that experience other forces and move in 3D. Write a `Particle` superclass that the `FreeFallParticle` is a subclass of. What fields go into the `Particle` class? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### End-product\n",
    " * Reply to the Piazza post (anonymously is totally fine) with your result on how long it takes for a particle to fall to the ground from a height of 10 meters. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Roles\n",
    " * Driver: in charge of sharing their screen and typing the code for this activity (the person that lives at the highest latitude)\n",
    " * Navigator: in charge of directing the driver what to code (everyone else; can be more than one person)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    " * Figure out who is in which role based on criteria above\n",
    " * Read through the current code and discuss as a team what needs to be done to complete the main goal (how long it takes for a particle to fall from 10 m)\n",
    "    * Hint: we provided some psuedocode to perform the the physics equations to simulate gravity at each timestep. Use those to modify the state of the particle by each time step.\n",
    "    * Hint: you may consider calling `simulate_timestep()` in a for-loop to figure out when the ball drops to 0 meters. \n",
    "    * Hint: if you are confused about which part of the code to modify, look for the `HINT:` comments in the text which indicate where you should write code! \n",
    " * Code it up and get an answer!\n",
    " * If you have time, discuss as a team how to accomplish the bonus activity and code that up as well. Check that you get the same answer from how long it takes a particle to fall from a height of 10 meters.\n",

    "Write a function that returns the history of heights that the object was at (and their corresponding times). For example, if the object was at `height = 1` at `time = 0`, `height = 0.902` at `t = 0.1`, and `height = 0.706` at `t = 0.2`, the function should return `[1, 0.902, 0.706]` for the heights and `[0, 0.1, 0.2]` for the corresponding times. Choose to implement it either in the object oriented or functional framework we provided. If you have time, try the other one too! \n"
